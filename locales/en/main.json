{"description":"In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to\n        demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful\n        content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before the final copy is available. It is\n        also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers\n        to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text\n        influencing the design. Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum\n        et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words\n        altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin. The first two words\n        themselves are a truncation of dolorem ipsum (\"pain itself\"). Versions of the Lorem ipsum\n        text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized by\n        advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. Lorem ipsum was introduced to the digital world\n        in the mid-1980s, when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its\n        desktop publishing program PageMaker","graphql_client":"GraphQL Client","history":"History","rest_client":"REST Client","title_primary":"Welcome Back!","title_secondary":"General information about the developers, project, and course:"}
